# Reading list

I use Chrome's reading list feature quite a lot, and I thought it would be interesting to build a replacement for it that I can use from any browser.

It's built with [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction) and (an attempt at) [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/).

Currently, the links are only persisted in the browser's local storage. In the future, I'd like to have a simple sync option. Suggestions are welcome!
